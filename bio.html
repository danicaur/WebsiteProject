      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I was raised in the beautiful city of Medellin, Colombia. 
        A city known for overcoming its social and economical struggles. 
        During my childhood I got to experience the transformation of my city, as it transitioned from being a center of violence to being one of the most innovatinve cities in the world.
